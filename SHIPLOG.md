# SHIPLOG — SkillAudit Shipping Log

## 2026-02-15 (10:00 AM) — Hardcoded Secret Detection Engine
**What:** 22 dedicated detectors for real API keys, tokens, and credentials embedded in skill files. New `/secrets/detectors` endpoint.
**Detects:** OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, AWS, Slack, Discord, Stripe, SendGrid, Google, Telegram, Mailgun, Vercel, npm, PyPI keys/tokens, PEM private keys, and generic high-entropy secret assignments.
**Smart features:** Shannon entropy validation, automatic placeholder suppression (won't flag `YOUR_KEY` or examples), secret redaction in output (only shows first 6 + last 2 chars), context-aware matching.
**Why:** This is the single biggest gap in the scanner. Existing rules caught env file access and token stealing *intent*, but couldn't detect actual leaked credentials sitting in skill files. Hardcoded secrets are the #1 real-world vulnerability in code — now SkillAudit catches them. This is what makes us a real security tool, not just a pattern matcher.

## 2026-02-15 — SVG Badge API
**What:** Embeddable SVG badge endpoints for READMEs and skill registries.
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /badge/:domain.svg` — returns shields.io-style SVG badge showing a domain's audit status (clean/low/moderate/high/critical/unaudited)
- `GET /badge/scan.svg?url=...` — live scan + SVG badge in one request (scan a skill, get a badge image back)
**Why:** Infrastructure play. If every skill README has a SkillAudit badge, we become visible everywhere skills are published — like build status badges for CI. This makes SkillAudit the default trust signal for agent skills.
**Usage:** `![SkillAudit](https://skillaudit.vercel.app/badge/scan.svg?url=https://example.com/SKILL.md)`
