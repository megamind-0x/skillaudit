# SHIPLOG — SkillAudit Shipping Log

## 2026-02-15 — SVG Badge API
**What:** Embeddable SVG badge endpoints for READMEs and skill registries.
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /badge/:domain.svg` — returns shields.io-style SVG badge showing a domain's audit status (clean/low/moderate/high/critical/unaudited)
- `GET /badge/scan.svg?url=...` — live scan + SVG badge in one request (scan a skill, get a badge image back)
**Why:** Infrastructure play. If every skill README has a SkillAudit badge, we become visible everywhere skills are published — like build status badges for CI. This makes SkillAudit the default trust signal for agent skills.
**Usage:** `![SkillAudit](https://skillaudit.vercel.app/badge/scan.svg?url=https://example.com/SKILL.md)`
